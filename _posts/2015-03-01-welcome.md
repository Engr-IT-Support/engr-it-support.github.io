# Engineering IT Support

Welcome to the public landing page for the <a href="https://engr-it-support.slack.com/">Engineering IT Support Slack group</a>. Our group is a <strong>safe, confidential space for professional IT folks supporting Electrical and Computer Engineering departments across the world </strong> to chat and support each other.

Too often, the IT needs of an ECE Department are unique to your users. Who else at your institution needs to deal with Cadence installations? If there isn't someone at your school you can ask questions of, then why not talk to your fellow ECE departments?
