## We're looking for fulltime Higher Education IT professionals working within a Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering -- or within a College of Engineering that is responsible for the IT support of an ECE department.

While we understand that some faculty or graduate students from one of these departments might have an interest in IT support, this group is not intended for that audience.
