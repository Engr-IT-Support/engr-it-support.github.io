## You are welcome to join Engineering IT Support chat if you're currently a fulltime professional working within a Higher Education IT support role within a Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering -- or within a College of Engineering that is responsible for the IT support of an ECE department.##

While we understand that some faculty or graduate students from one of these departments might have an interest in IT support, this group is not intended for that audience.
